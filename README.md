### **Project Plan for Anti-Phishing Tool**

#### **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Planning**  
**Deliverable:** Detailed project scope, architecture design, and timeline.  
1. **Tasks:**  
   - Finalize functional and non-functional requirements.  
   - Identify integration points with email servers and clients.  
   - Select technology stack (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, ML/AI tools).  
2. **Technical Considerations:**  
   - Ensure compatibility with email systems (e.g., Microsoft Exchange, Gmail).  
   - Plan for scalability and performance optimization.  

---

#### **Phase 2: Admin Configuration Panel Development**  
**Deliverable:** Centralized admin interface for managing phishing detection settings.  
1. **Tasks:**  
   - Design and develop a user-friendly admin dashboard.  
   - Implement features:  
     - Phishing detection rules configuration.  
     - Whitelist/blacklist management.  
     - Alert thresholds and notification setup.  
     - Phishing attempt monitoring and reporting.  
2. **Technical Considerations:**  
   - Use a secure web framework (e.g., Django, React).  
   - Ensure role-based access control (RBAC) for admin security.  

---

#### **Phase 3: Agent Development**  
**Deliverable:** Lightweight agent for phishing detection on email servers and clients.  
1. **Tasks:**  
   - Develop server-based agent for email server integration.  
   - Develop client-based agent for email client integration.  
   - Implement real-time email scanning features:  
     - Domain spoofing detection.  
     - Link and attachment analysis.  
     - AI/ML-based anomaly detection.  
   - Add email blocking/quarantine functionality.  
2. **Technical Considerations:**  
   - Optimize for low resource usage to avoid performance impact.  
   - Use encryption for secure email data processing.  
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).  

---

#### **Phase 4: Integration and Testing**  
**Deliverable:** Fully integrated tool with email systems and thorough testing.  
1. **Tasks:**  
   - Integrate the agent with email servers and clients.  
   - Test functionality:  
     - Phishing detection accuracy.  
     - Performance under high email volumes.  
     - User and admin notification workflows.  
   - Conduct security and compliance audits.  
2. **Technical Considerations:**  
   - Use automated testing frameworks (e.g., Selenium, pytest).  
   - Simulate phishing attempts for accuracy testing.  
   - Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance in data handling.  

---

#### **Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment**  
**Deliverable:** Ready-to-use tool with comprehensive documentation.  
1. **Tasks:**  
   - Create user and admin documentation (installation, configuration, usage).  
   - Package and deploy the tool for on-premises and cloud environments.  
   - Provide training for administrators and end-users.  
2. **Technical Considerations:**  
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) for code and documentation.  
   - Plan for regular updates to phishing detection databases.  

---

#### **Phase 6: Maintenance and Support**  
**Deliverable:** Ongoing updates and user support.  
1. **Tasks:**  
   - Monitor tool performance and user feedback.  
   - Release periodic updates for new phishing techniques.  
   - Provide technical support for users and admins.  
2. **Technical Considerations:**  
   - Set up a bug tracking system (e.g., Jira).  
   - Implement an automated update mechanism for the agent.  

---

### **Timeline**  
1. **Phase 1:** 2 weeks  
2. **Phase 2:** 4 weeks  
3. **Phase 3:** 6 weeks  
4. **Phase 4:** 4 weeks  
5. **Phase 5:** 2 weeks  
6. **Phase 6:** Ongoing  

---

### **Key Success Metrics**  
1. **Functionality:** Phishing detection accuracy and integration success.  
2. **Performance:** Minimal impact on email server and client performance.  
3. **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from admins and end-users.  
4. **Compliance:** Adherence to data privacy regulations.
